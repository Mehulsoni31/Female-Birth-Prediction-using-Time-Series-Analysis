# Female-Birth-Prediction-using-Time-Series-Analysis
This project aims to develop a predictive model for forecasting the number of female births in the next 15 days using time series analysis techniques. The model is trained on historical birth data and leverages the power of time series analysis to capture the underlying patterns and trends in the data.
